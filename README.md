# Decision Making Tool 🤔🛠️

## 📌 Task Description
This repository contains an implementation of the **Decision Making Tool** task from Rolling Scopes School Stage 2 curriculum.

https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/stage2/tasks/decision-making-tool/README.md

The goal of this project was to build a **web-based interactive tool** that helps users make decisions based on user-provided options. The tool selects a random choice from the list of options entered by the user, according to the specification provided in the task documentation.

This project is inspired by classic decision helpers, and was built with simplicity, usability, and clear logic in mind.

## 🧠 Application Overview
The Decision Making Tool allows a user to:

- Enter multiple decision **options**
- Add new options dynamically
- Remove individual options
- Remove all options at once
- Ask the tool to **pick one random option**
- See the selected option clearly displayed

This turns a list of possibilities into a single recommended choice using simple randomness, helping users decide efficiently.
